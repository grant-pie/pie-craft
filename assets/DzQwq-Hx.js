                  <p>More mysteries, I love all the strange mysteries surrounding the game. I would definitely add more different dimensions and more mythical creatures.</p>
                  <br>
                  <strong> If you could add one new mob to the game, what would it be and why?</strong>
                  <p>Like I said, more mythical creatures, maybe one for each biome. Like the for the cherry blossom biome I would add a mushroom mob and for the oak woods - bats.</p>
